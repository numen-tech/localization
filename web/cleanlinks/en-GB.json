    "title": "FAQ",
    "description": "Frequently asked questions about Clean Links",
    "whatIs": {
      "question": "What is Clean Links?",
      "answer": "Clean Links is a free utility for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that strips tracking parameters from URLs and reveals the true target behind QR codes and shortened links - so you open only things that you want to, without hidden trackers or redirects."
    },
    "deviceRequirements": {
      "question": "Which devices and iOS versions does Clean Links support?",
      "answer": "Clean Links supports iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices that can run iOS 18.0 or later (iPhone/iPad) or macOS Sequoia or later."
    },
    "whyCreate": {
      "question": "Why did we create Clean Links?",
      "answer": "We initially built it for ourselves to avoid getting \"quished\" and to protect ourselves from tracking-filled links. We later learned that phishing and quishing are affecting a lot of good people, many of them from a technical background, all over the world. So, we decided to release it for everyone and made it completely free."
    },
    "privacyProtection": {
      "question": "How does Clean Links protect my privacy?",
      "answer": "All processing happens on your device - no cookies, identifiers, or analytics data ever leave your phone. Clean Links simply removes known tracking parameters (UTM tags, affiliate IDs, ad-tech tokens) before loading a link. For shortened links, we make requests in an isolated context, without any cookies, sessions etc. This defeats the tracking via cookies that URL shorteners, advertisers and data brokers use to track users."
    },
    "phishingProtection": {
      "question": "Can Clean Links block phishing (\"quishing\") attempts?",
      "answer": "Yes. When you scan a QR code, Clean Links shows you the full, unmasked URL. You can then decide whether to open it. This is unlike the iOS Camera app and other paid QR code reader apps, which simply open the link the QR code is pointing to, without your consent. Furthermore, while following redirects, Clean Links uses lower-level (NSURLRequest) APIs that have a very small attack surface compared to that of a fully-fledged web browser. This means Clean Links is immune to most zero-day exploits that target web browsers. Secondly, the app runs within its own sandbox, which adds another layer of security."
    },
    "historyStorage": {
      "question": "Does Clean Links store my history or checked QR codes?",
      "answer": "No. By design, Clean Links does not log or store links you clean or check."
    },
    "cleanWorkflow": {
      "question": "How do I clean a link I've copied?",
      "answer": "You can create an Apple Shortcut that takes the URL from your clipboard, cleans it, and puts the cleaned link back. For example, download this <shortcut>one-tap shortcut</shortcut>. For even faster access, assign that shortcut to your iPhone's Action button (iPhone 15 Pro and later) so a single press anywhere cleans the clipboard link. You can add Clean Links to your Control Centre on iPhone, iPad, and Mac: choose from two actions-\"Open App\" or \"QR Reader.\" Access these directly in Control Centre or on the Lock Screen, or assign them to the Action button for one-tap cleaning from anywhere. You can also open the Clean Links app manually and paste your URL to clean it."
    },
    "qrScanning": {
      "question": "How do I check a QR code?",
      "answer": "Launch Clean Links from your Home Screen, Shortcut, or Action button on iPhone, iPad, or Mac and point your camera at the code. You'll see the real destination URL before choosing to open it. Clean Links follows any redirects and strips tracking parameters from the final destination-preventing phishing links hidden behind short-link or redirection services."
    },
    "urlExpansion": {
      "question": "Can I expand and preview shortened URLs?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Paste or share any bit.ly, TinyURL, t.co, or other short link into Clean Links. It unshortens all redirect chains and shows you the final URL before you tap."
    },
    "qrGeneration": {
      "question": "Can I generate a privacy-safe QR code from a cleaned link?",
      "answer": "Yes. After cleaning a URL, tap \"Generate QR\" to create a new code you can share completely free of tracking parameters. This is especially handy when you want to share the cleaned link with friends: one tap and they can check your QR code to open the exact same, tracker-free URL. Also useful when you're trying to share content with your Android using friends, without being surveilled by cough cough: What's that app called again? This helps you and your friends avoid getting plastered with ads related to the content that you just shared, for the next week or two."
    },
    "systemIntegration": {
      "question": "Does Clean Links work inside Safari, Mail, and other apps?",
      "answer": "Yes. Clean Links' system-wide Share Sheet extension on iPhone, iPad, and Mac can be used within Safari, Mail, X (Twitter), Youtube, LinkedIn, or any other app that uses native Share Sheets."
    },
    "shortcutsAutomation": {
      "question": "Can I automate link cleaning with Shortcuts or Siri?",
      "answer": "Clean Links provides App Intents that work with both Apple Shortcuts and Siri. You can build a shortcut that cleans links from your clipboard or anything else. For example, use this <shortcut>\"Clean Links\" shortcut</shortcut> to get the link from your clipboard, clean it, and paste the cleaned URL back to the clipboard."
    },
    "manualCleaning": {
      "question": "Why do I need this app and why can't I just clean links manually?",
      "answer": "Most tracking parameters are now hidden behind redirects such as t.co, l.facebook.com, l.instagram.com, and lnkd.in - you cannot see these parameters until you click. Clean Links automatically handles this for you, saving you from tedious manual work and protecting you from hidden trackers."
    },
    "localProcessing": {
      "question": "Is this really local? I see it makes network requests to the URL",
      "answer": "Yes, Clean Links processes everything on your device. Clean Links can clean most links with tracking parameters and redirection links fully offline, without making any network requests. For links from URL shorteners and certain ad networks, the redirection URL cannot be computed from the URL alone. In such cases, Clean Links makes network requests directly from your device to resolve tracking parameters that are hidden behind redirects - this is technically necessary because many trackers are only revealed after following the redirect chain. However, there's no third-party API involved (not even our own servers). Every request starts with a completely clean slate: no cookies are persisted between requests, no browsing history is maintained, and we use sandboxed sessions with randomised user agents. We also remove tracking parameters before and after following every redirect. URL shorteners are mostly used to hide tracking parameters in URLs and this feature of Clean Links fixes that loophole, something that cannot be done by manually copying and pasting parts of links or by web apps like \"Link Cleaner\" that do not follow redirects. Most importantly, we do not log or track what links you clean. Ever. Your link cleaning activity stays completely private on your device. For additional privacy protection, we recommend using iCloud Private Relay or a VPN to mask your IP address when Clean Links makes these necessary network requests to resolve redirects."
    },
    "safariAtfp": {
      "question": "How is Clean Links different from Safari's Advanced Tracking & Fingerprinting Protection in iOS 26?",
      "answer": "Safari's Advanced Tracking & Fingerprinting Protection (ATFP) in iOS 26 is excellent at reducing tracking during Safari browsing, but it has limitations. ATFP only works in Safari, not in in-app browsers (like Instagram or TikTok web views) or other browsers. It also doesn't preview short links or clean trackers that appear at the end of redirect chains. Clean Links complements ATFP by working system-wide across all apps, following every redirect hop, and showing you the final URL before you open it. When you share links, Clean Links removes platform wrappers (like t.co or l.instagram.com) so your recipients get truly clean URLs regardless of whether they use Safari or have ATFP enabled. Use both together: keep ATFP on in Safari for automatic in-browser protection, and use Clean Links before opening or sharing links to handle shorteners, redirects, and cross-app scenarios. <link>Read our detailed comparison</link> to learn more."
    },
    "vsOtherCleaners": {
      "question": "How is Clean Links different from other URL cleaners like Firefox, Brave, or Link Cleaner?",
      "answer": "Most URL cleaners (including Firefox, Brave, and web-based tools like Link Cleaner) focus on trimming visible tracking parameters from the URL you provide. They don't follow redirect chains, so trackers hidden behind shortlinks (bit.ly, t.co, lnkd.in) or social wrappers (l.facebook.com, l.instagram.com) slip through. Firefox even maintains an allowlist that lets certain big-tech trackers through. Clean Links is different: it follows every redirect hop, expands shortlinks, and strips trackers at each step-revealing the final destination before you open it. Clean Links also includes a built-in QR code reader that previews URLs safely, works 100% on-device with no analytics (unlike Link Cleaner's anonymous usage stats), and integrates natively with iOS Share Sheets, Shortcuts, Siri, and Mac clipboard monitoring. If you want comprehensive protection that catches hidden trackers and works across all your Apple devices, Clean Links is designed to do just that. <link>See the full comparison with Link Cleaner</link> for more details."
    },
    "sendToMac": {
      "question": "How do I send links from my iPhone to my Mac?",
      "answer": "Clean Links lets you share links from iPhone to Mac using the share sheet. Your iOS device and Mac must have Clean Links installed, iCloud enabled, and be signed into the same Apple account. Links are sent via iCloud sync, so they work even when your Mac is offline or on a different network - the link will appear automatically when your Mac comes online. This is faster than AirDrop, more reliable than Safari tabs, and works with any browser on your Mac. <link>Read our detailed guide on sending links from iPhone to Mac</link> to learn more."

    },
    "sendToMacMultipleMacs": {
      "question": "Can I send links to multiple Macs?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can send links to all your Macs as long as you have Clean Links for macOS installed on them and they are signed into the same Apple account. You can disable receiving links in the macOS app's settings if you want to exclude a specific Mac."
    },
    "sendToMacShortcuts": {
      "question": "Can I use Send to Mac with Shortcuts?",
