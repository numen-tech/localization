It removes: hidden characters (like zero-width spaces), suspicious punctuation and homoglyphs (letters that look like others). It can also normalise spelling (e.g., from US to UK English) and fix punctuation for you."

          "question": "Why does the app download files after I install it?",
          "answer": "To give you a faster download from the App Store and save storage space on your device, we keep the initial app size small. The first time you launch Slop Or Not, it automatically downloads our powerful AI detection models using Apple's On-Demand Resources system. This is a one-time process. Occasionally, issues with Apple's service can interrupt this download. If it seems stuck, please check your internet connection and restart the app after a few minutes. The download should resume automatically."
        },
        "imageResolution": {
          "question": "Does image resolution affect detection scores?",
          "answer": "Yes. When you use a low-resolution thumbnail or a screenshot, the model still runs but may return a lower confidence score because fine details are lost during our normalisation step. Always try to use the original or highest-quality version of the picture. More pixels mean more clues for the detector, so results are stronger and more stable."
        },
        "howMuchText": {
          "question": "How much text do I need for reliable detection?",
          "answer": "The text detector needs at least two full sentences to work. Very short snippets give too little context for the model to spot AI fingerprints. Whenever possible, paste a whole paragraph or the entire document. The longer the passage, the higher the detection confidence."
        },
        "notDetecting": {
          "question": "The app isn't detecting AI content I'm sure is AI-generated. Why?",
          "answer": {
            "intro": "The world of AI is changing fast. While our detector is highly accurate, some new AI models may create content that is harder to detect. We regularly update our models to keep up.",
            "checkImage": "The image you checked might be a low-resolution thumbnail or a heavily compressed screenshot. Try again with the highest-resolution version available.",
            "checkText": "The text sample could be too short. Make sure you provide at least two sentences; more text improves the results.",
